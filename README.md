## Terraform introduction

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

Version used:
*   Terraform 0.14.*

## Vsphere authentification
The vsphere provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by vsoere. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

```
provider "vsphere" {
  user           = "my-litle-user"
  password       = "secret"
  vsphere_server = "my-vcenter.com"
}
```

## Getting Started

Before running Terraform operations, download plugins using the `terraform init` command.
```
terraform init
```

Show us what Terraform is going to do before runninng the operation.
```
terraform plan
```

Apply the plan that we just created, which will provision our VMs.
```
terraform apply
```

Destroy infrastructure we previously created.

```
